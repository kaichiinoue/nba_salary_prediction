# NBA players salary prediction: Overview
- Built a model that can predict NBA players salaries based on their performances in the last season.
- Web scraped all the players stats from a website called Basketball-Reference

## motivation
There are some superstarts in NBA who earn crazy amount of money every year. As a huge basketball fan, I got to think whether their performances from the last season is the pure factors that determine their salary of the next season. 

## Web Scraping
- Webscraped all the palyers data from a website called [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a site that has all data of professional basketball including not only NBA but also G League and WNBA.
- For salary information, there was a problem with getting salary data from Basketball Reference, so I used another website called [HOOPSHYPE](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2020-2021/) to get salary data for every player.
