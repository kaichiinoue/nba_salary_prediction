# NBA players salary prediction: Overview
- Built a model that can predict NBA players salaries based on their performances in the last season.
- Web scraped all the players stats from a website called [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and [HOOPSHYPE](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2020-2021/)

## motivation
There are some superstarts in NBA who earn crazy amount of money every year. As a huge basketball fan, I got to think whether their performances from the last season is the pure factors that determine their salary of the next season. 

## Web Scraping
Webscraped all the palyers data from a website called [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a site that has all data of professional basketball including not only NBA but also G League and WNBA. For salary information, there was a problem with getting salary data from Basketball Reference, so I used another website called [HOOPSHYPE](https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2020-2021/) to get salary data for every player.
As a stat for each player, we got the following:
- Pos (Position)
- Age (Player's age on February 1st of the season)
- Tm (Team)
- G (Games)
- GS (Games that a player was in starting member)
- MP (Minutes played)
- FG (Field Goals)
- FGA (Field Goals Attempts)
- FG% (Field Goals Percentage)
- 3P (3-Points Field Gaols)
- 3PA (3-Points Field Goals Attempts)
- 3P% (3-Points Field Goals Percentage)
- 2P (2-Points Field Gaols)
- 2PA (2-Points Field Goals Attempts)
- 2P% (2-Points Field Goals Percentage)
- eFG% (Effective Field Goals Percentage)
- FT (Free Throws)
